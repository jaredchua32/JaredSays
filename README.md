# JaredSays

This is my first ever JavaScript project. 

JaredSays is an exact clone of the famous game [Simon Says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Says).

With this project I learned about different game "states." I've also familiarized myself with jQuery more with this project. I tried to write JaredSays with the cleanest code possible, although I did not do so with the module pattern.

Feel free to view JaredSays from my site [here](http://jaredchua.com/jaredsays/jaredsays.html) or checkout the source by typing the following into your git terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/jaredchua32/JGrid.git`
